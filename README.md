# Optum.VendingMachineApp
A console-based vending machine simulation that accepts coins, manages inventory, and dispenses products using a state-driven design.

## Problem
Build a vending machine that accepts only valid coins, rejects invalid ones, manages product selection, and handles inventory and change, all while reflecting real-world vending machine behavior.

## Solution
We implemented the State design pattern to model the vending machine's behavior, making it easy to manage complex transitions (like coin insertion, product selection, and dispensing) and to extend or modify states independently for maintainability and clarity.
